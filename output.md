11. **Conflict Resolution:** How will you handle conflicts? How can a
    member signal an issue? How will the group respond?

    If a member can't deliver on a promise, they should mention in

    adjusting the timeline.

    **Tip:**

    Establish a protocol for resolving conflicts and seek help from
    course staff if needed.
