5.  **Communication:** How will you communicate? What are your
    expectations for response times? How often will you meet, and for
    how long? What technology will you use?

    **Tip:**

    Schedule a mandatory weekly meeting to stay on track and address
    issues promptly.

    **Answer:**

    We will be using Discord to communicate. The expected response time
    should be at most a couple of hours. We plan on doing a weekly
    virtual meeting on Discord to keep everyone up to date and address
    any issues or difficulties.

6.  **Preparation for Meetings:** What should members do before each
    weekly meeting?

    **Tip:**

    Create a list of to-do items at the end of each meeting and review
    them at the next meeting.

    **Answer:**

    Prepare a short paragraph about what they have done in the previous week.
    Brainstorm ideas of what to do in the following week.

8.  **Meeting Conduct:** What are your expectations for attitudes and
    responses during meetings? How will you manage turn-taking and
    ensure everyone contributes? How will you make decisions?

    **Answer:**

    We will make sure to show some respect when people are sharing their ideas.
    We will use a spinning wheel to determine who is contributing first and will make sure that everyone gets a chance to share their insights.
    We will make decisions based on majority votes through an anonymous voting platform that does not reveal names.

    **Tip:**

    Structure meetings effectively and decide on a method for resolving
    disagreements, such as consensus or majority vote.

10.  **Work Structure:** How will you structure the work? Will most of it
    be done during or outside of meetings? How will you assign
    responsibilities?

    **Answer:**

    We will try our best spliting the workload equally. But we know that's not always possible. In the event that 
    somebody takes a heavier task, we will credit that in the following week by allowing them to pick their tasks first.
    Most of the work will be done outside of meetings. Meetings are mainly logistic stuff and to check whether all of
    us are on the right track to make sure we don't fall behind in the project. We will assign responsibilities based
    on people's interest and passion. If someone has shown strong interest in certain part of the project, we will
    most likely assign that part to the person.

    **Tip:**

    Use a divide-and-conquer approach, ensuring an equal workload for
    all members.

11.  **Submission of Deliverables:** How will you submit deliverables?
    Will all members review the submission before it's finalized? When
    should the write-up be ready for review?

    **Answer:**

    Yes. All members will review the submission before it's finalized. However, it will be in the form of handling
    pull requests. We will give each person some pull requests from others. They have the right to accept or reject
    other people's pull requests. The write-up is ready for review when all the pull requests are handled and all
    the rejected pull requests have been amended.

    **Tip:**

    Communicate struggles early and work together to find solutions.

11.  **Handling Surprises:** How will you deal with unexpected
    challenges? What should a member do if they can't deliver on a
    promise? How will the group respond?

    **Answer:**

    We encourage members to communicate struggles early at the start of the project.
    We understand that in some weeks people have lots of deadlines. 
    In the even that a member cannot deliver on time, they should inform the project manager ahead of the time
    so they will get less work but in the following they are responsible for some of the heavier tasks.
    **Tip:**

    Communicate struggles early and work together to find solutions.

11. **Conflict Resolution:** How will you handle conflicts? How can a
    member signal an issue? How will the group respond?

    **Answer:**

    If a member can't deliver on a promise, they should mention in
    advance so the team has time to respond. Possible resolution
    includes assigning parts of the work to another member and possibly
    adjusting the timeline.

    **Tip:**

    Establish a protocol for resolving conflicts and seek help from
    course staff if needed.
